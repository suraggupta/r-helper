Many a time, we deal with R code that takes a long time to run, or in other words, I-slept-at-11-PM-woke-up-at-10-AM-my-code-is-still-running. In such cases, it might be helpful for us to have an alert set up on our smartphones to let us know that our code has completed successfully (or unsuccessfully).

The Pushover app is there just for that. It's an app for your smartphone that enables custom push notifications. And with the `pushoverr` package in R, using R to send push notifications to your device just got easier.

Check out this simple guide on how to use `pushoverr` to send notifications to your device. This package was developed by Brian Connelly, and a comprehensive description of the package can be found at https://github.com/briandconnelly/pushoverr.
